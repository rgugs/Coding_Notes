# Coding_Notes

I learn best when pretending to develop lesson plans for teaching, so these are all the notes I've pulled together for learning coding. They aren't meant as an actual product, so reference at your own risk. It isn't always marked if they are complete or in progress. I added in sources where I could remember them. These are all transcribed from my handwritten notes and I didn't always document sources when I first started taking them. They are still undergoing a lot of restructuring as I continue to add to them, so don't assume the order of anything has any importance at this point in time.
