## What is Clean Code?

Clean code refers to the following different design patterns to help keep code organized and easy to read by developers.

* DRY
* KISS
* YAGNI

### Clean Code DOES NOT

* Make programs run faster
* Make programs run correctly
* Only occur in a single style of coding like OOP

### Clean Code DOES

* Make code easier to work with
* Make code easier to find and fix bugs
* Make the development process faster
* Help us retain our sanity

### DRY Code

DRY stands for **"Don't Repeat Yourself"**. When possible, avoid writing the same code multiple times because it can get messy if you have to change it later and might miss one of the places you repeated it, causing a bug. It is also more work to keep writing it over and over.

### KISS

KISS stands for **Keep It Simple, Stupid**. The more complex your code, the more likely to have a bug and the harder it is to debug. Complexity does not equal better.

### YAGNI

YAGNI stands for **You Ainâ€™t Gonna Need It**. Developers are often guilty of adding in extra functionality when the idea pops into their head, not necessarily when it is needed in a project. Focus on a minimalist approach with only critical features for the first version of a project, and only add on functionality as needed. This promotes the KISS principal and more modular architecture that improves flexibility and cost effectiveness.

## Coding Paradigms

Paradigms are designated patterns used in coding that define standards for organizing data and functions. They can all benefit from Clean Code Principals. For a more indepth explanation of each paradigm, review their respective pages of notes.

* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Functional Programming (FP)
* Procedural Programming
* Declarative Programming
