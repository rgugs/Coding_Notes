# Basic Python Concepts

## Clean Code

Clean code refers to following different paradigms or design patterns to help keep code organized and easy to read by developers.

### Clean Code Does NOT :

* Make programs run faster
* Make programs run correctly
* Only occur in a single style of coding like OOP

### Clean Code DOES :

* Make code easier to work with
* Make code easier to find and fix bugs
* Make the development process faster
* Help us retain our sanity

## What is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?

A pattern for writing code that uses classes and treats everything as objects. In Python, everything itself is an object, so OOP works well for Python, however it is not an enforced pattern as in some other languages.

## DRY Code

DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. When possible, avoid writing the same code multiple times because it can get messy if you have to change it later and might miss one of the places you repeated it, causing a bug. It is also more work to keep writing it over and over.
